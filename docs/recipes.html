<H3><a name="spare-ribs">Pork Spare Ribs in BBQ Sauce</a></H3>

<ul>
  <li> pork spare ribs - 500 gm - the thin ones are best 
  <li> 2 sweet potatoes
  <li> 2 large onions
  <li> 6 cloves of garlic
  <li> 3 tb brown sugar
  <li> 3 tb vinegar  (doesn't matter which kind - cheap and strong)
  <li> 1 tb mustard powder (maybe you could substitute chilli if nec)
  <li> 2 tb worcestershire sauce
  <li> 1 tb tomato puree
  <li> Tomatoes - 800gm tin or approx 1 kg fresh
</ul>
<ol>
  <li> Put meat in baking tin without any oil.  Bake at 200C for 20-30
      min.  Pour off the fat that has come off the meat. 

  <li> While meat is cooking, prepare the sauce and cut the sweet
potatoes into smallish chunks.

  <li>Fry up onions and garlic and add ingredients in the order
listed.  Add some water if necessary - it should be thick but still
have plenty of liquid in order to keep the meat moist as it cooks.
Also taste, to adjust the sweet-sour-heat balance to taste.  Allow
sauce to cook gently, until the meat is read.  Then pour the fat off
the meat and add the sweet potatoes.  Finally pour the sauce onto the
meat and put back in the oven.

  <li>Reduce the heat to about 180C after about 20 minutes, but keep baking
for another 60 minutes.  Keep an eye on the cooking to make sure the
spare ribs do not burn.  If they are not completely covered with the
sauce, you may need to baste them (spoon up the sauce and put it over
the meat) a few times.

  <li>Serve with rice and some veggies. Amounts are enough to deal with
enough meat to feed 5 or so people.  If you have more, just multiply
the sauce up, and you might need to increase the cooking time a
little.  The meat should be soft and coming off the bones.  
</ol>

<H3><a name="kalbi-chim">Kalbi Chim (Korean steamed beef ribs)</a></H3>

<ul>
  <li> Beef ribs - 1000 gm - slice through the ribs, in thin slices
  <li> 1.5 cup water
  <li> 6 tb sugar (brown or white)
  <li> 1 tb rice-wine (sake)
  <li> 6 tb soy sauce
  <li> 2 tb sesame
  <li> 1 tb sesame oil
  <li> 0.5 large onion (grated)
  <li> 5 tb spring onions (chopped)
  <li> 2 pieces dark chocolate (melted)
  <li> 6 cloves of garlic
  <li> salt and pepper to taste    
</ul>

<ol>
  <li> Soak the ribs in cold water to remove the blood:  leave in
      water for one hour, then throw the water away.
  <li> Put meat in shallow pan (best if it has thick base).  Mix all
      the other ingredients together, melting the chocolate so it will
      mix, and pour over the meat.
  <li> Simmer for more than one hour (maybe even two), until the meast
      is very tender and the sauce has thickened.
  <li> Serve with rice and kimchee.  Serves 5-6 people.   If you have
      more, just multiply the sauce up, and you might need to increase
      the cooking time a little.   
  <li> If you have some leftovers, try mixing the rice in with the
      sauce when you heat them up.  It's delicious.

<h3><a name="farfollini">Farfalloni con Funghi (Bowties and Mushrooms)</h3>
<ul>
   <li> 40 g    butter
   <li> 400 g   fresh mushrooms (whole if small, sliced if large)
   <li> 2 tbsp  oil
   <li> 400 g   minced pork
   <li> 1-2 cloves garlic, crushed
   <li> 1/2 tsp dried basil
   <li> 1/2 tsp dried oregano
   <li>         salt & pepper
   <li> 100 ml  white wine (red wine is also good)
   <li> 2 tbsp  flour
   <li> 3 tbsp  tomato puree
   <li> 200 ml  beef stock
   <li> 300 g   farfalloni (bow tie pasta)
   <li>         freshly grated parmesan cheese
</ul>
<ol>
<li>  In a saucepan melt the butter over medium heat and  saute the
    mushrooms until cooked.  Set aside.

<li> Heat the oil and brown the pork and garlic in it, breaking up any
    lumps with a wooden spoon.  (Pour off the juice and, if there is
    time, cool to remove the fat.)

<li> Turn up the heat and pour in the wine.  Let it boil rapidly until
    the foam subsides then add the flour stirring well.

<li>  Add the tomato puree, stock and herbs.  Stir well and leave to simmer
    over a low flame for about 25 minutes.  Stir quite often, as the
    sauce is thick and soon starts to stick to the bottom of the pan.
    When done add the reserved mushrooms and the juice from step 2.

<li>  Cook the farfalloni in plenty of boiling water (add salt when
    boiling) until al dente.  Drain.  To get the timing right, you
    need to put the water on about 10-15 minutes after the sauce
    started simmering.

<li>  Mix together the farfalloni and meat-mushroom sauce and serve
    immediately.  Pass the grated parmesan separately.
</ol>
<p>The sauce can be made hours in advance, just re-heat while the pasta
is cooking.  The sauce is also good with egg noodles of any width.</p>
