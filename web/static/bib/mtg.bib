                  students{'} learning by involving them in sense
                  tagging. The main goal is to lead students to
                  discover how we can represent meaning and where the
                  limits of our current theories lie. A subsidiary
                  goal is to create sense tagged corpora and an
                  accompanying linked lexicon (in our case
                  wordnets). We present the results of tagging several
                  texts and suggest some ways in which the tagging
                  process could be improved. Two authors of this paper
                  present their own experience as students. Overall,
                  students reported that they found the tagging an
                  enriching experience. The annotated corpora and
                  changes to the wordnet are made available through
                  the NTU multilingual corpus and associated wordnets
                  (NTU-MC).",

                  a gap in natural language understanding about
                  actions, specifically that of understanding
                  commands. We propose a new method for commonsense
                  inference (grounding) of high-level natural language
                  commands into specific action commands for further
                  execution by a robotic system. The method allows to
                  build a knowledge base that consists of a large set
                  of commonsense inferences. The preliminary results
                  have been presented.",

  abstract =	 "Despite the magnitude of recent progress in natural
                  language processing and multilingual language
                  modeling research, the vast majority of NLP research
                  is focused on English and other major
                  languages. This is because recent NLP research is
                  mainly data-driven, and there is more data for
                  resource-rich languages. In particular, Large
                  Language Models (LLM) make use of large unlabeled
                  datasets, a resource that many languages do not
                  have. In this project, we built a new, open-sourced
                  dictionary of Singlish, a contact variety that
                  contains features from English and other local
                  languages and is syntactically, phonologically and
                  lexically distinct from Standard English (Tan,
                  2010). First, a list of Singlish words was extracted
                  from various online sources. Then using an open
                  Chat-GPT LLM API, the description, including the
                  defintion, part of speech, pronunciation and
                  examples was produced. These were then refined
                  through post processing carried out by a native
                  speaker. The dictionary currently has 1,783 entries
                  and is published under the CC-BY-SA license. The
                  project was carried out with the intention of
                  facilitating future Singlish research and other
                  applications as the accumulation and management of
                  language resources will be of great help in
                  promoting research on the language in the future.",
